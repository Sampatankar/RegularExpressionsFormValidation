# RegularExpressionsFormValidation

VanillaJS(no arrows) with Regular Expressions

This project is the project within Section 9: Error Handling & Regular Expressions from Brad Traversy's MNodern JS course on Udemy.com

I am keeping the project with a few tweaks as it shows some good examples of how to use regular expressions in vanilla JS for name, zip, email and (US) telephone number form validation.
